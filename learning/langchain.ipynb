My family decided to homeschool when I was in 5th grade, and I did that until I took the CHSPE in 10th grade and went to community college. Ultimately, homeschooling ended up being a really good thing for me, even though my brother was the main reason we decided to do it. I got my associates in interdisciplinary studies (specifically with an emphasis in math and science. It's the dumbest degree ever, but it did help me get all my generals out of the way). I am now finishing out my last year at BYU with a bachelors' in computer science. I sometimes regret not going to business school, but here we are. As far as occupations, I taught piano lessons for 5 years, and it has made me decide that I want to be a business owner.

I want to use the God-given talents I have to make a difference in the world. I can't solve every problem but I will solve some meaningful problems for people.
